# Fractal-dimension-approximation-and-data-sets
The project was supported in part by the funds provided by the University of Rochester Office of Undergraduate Research. attached are the codes for comparision between PCA and Discrete-S energy's performance on fractal data set, and the proof of the critical value of s in low dimensional case, the similar idea can be extended to greater dimension.
